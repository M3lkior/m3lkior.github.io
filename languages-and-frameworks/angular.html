Angular offers excellent tools for building large-scale applications.</p>
<p>For instance, it includes built-in capabilities for setting up and managing a monorepo, simplifying the sharing of components across multiple projects. As a framework, Angular takes an opinionated approach to solving various problems, reducing the need for extensive decision-making while maintaining consistency, yet still providing flexibility where necessary. Angular 15 further stabilizes standalone components, a feature introduced in Angular 14, with the aim of simplifying Angular applications and reducing module complexity, addressing a common criticism of Angular.</p>
<p>The ease of upgrading to new versions has improved significantly due to the framework's stability and the detailed migration guides provided by the maintainers.</p>
