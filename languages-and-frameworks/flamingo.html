It is used to build scalable and maintainable (web)applications.</p>
<p>Flamingo is:</p>
<ul>
<li>open source</li>
<li>written in go</li>
<li>easy to learn</li>
<li>fast and flexible</li>
</ul>
<p>Go as simple, powerful and typesafe language is great to implement and scale serverside logic.
Flamingo has a clean architecture with clear dependencies in mind and offers a typical features and support for nowadays web applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful Templating Engines, e.g. support for Pug templates with reusable mixins and lightweight scripting.</li>
<li>Configuration concepts using yml and support for multiple areas and contexts</li>
<li>Powerful Dependency Injection</li>
<li>A Module concept for building modular and pluggable applications</li>
<li>Authentication concepts and security middleware</li>
<li>Flexible routing with support for prefix routes and reverse routing</li>
<li>Web Controller Support with: Request / Response / Form Handling etc</li>
<li>Operational Readiness: Logging, (distributed) Tracing, Metrics and Healthchecks with separate endpoint</li>
<li>Localisation</li>
<li>Commands</li>
<li>Session Handling and Management</li>
<li>GraphQL support and therefore support to build nice SPA and PWAs on top of it</li>
<li>Resilience and Caching for external APIs calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flamingo itself does not contain ORM Mapper or libraries - instead it emphasizes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://m3lkior.github.io/methods-and-patterns/ports-and-adapters.html">"ports and adapters"</a> architecture - so that you have a technology free (domain) model and any possible (and replaceable) persistence behind it.
That makes Flamingo useful to build microservices and applications - especially to build "frontends" or portals that require interaction with other (micro) services in a distributed architecture. 
When sticking to the architectural recommendation, you can build modular applications with replaceable adapters that gives you independent testability.</p>
<p>With <strong>"Flamingo Commerce"</strong> there is an additional active projects that offer rich and flexible features to build modern e-commerce applications.</p>
