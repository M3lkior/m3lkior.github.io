With proper OOP, support for clojures and a steadily improving type system, it has become a very mature language.
However, in the past 3 years, Facebook introduced HHVM, which became a major influence on PHP 7 and eventually brought a lot of improvements not only for the execution speed, but also with proper type hints and other features.</p>
<p>Here at AOE, we have numerous PHP projects, and we often kept it backwards-compatible to make sure that it will run on older systems. This is comparable to the procedure most frameworks (Magento, OroPlatform and derived projects) use.</p>
<p>Now, PHP 5 has reached its end--of-life, and it is time to discontinue the backwards-compatibility in favor of better and more stable applications.
Even though we can use the PHP 7 runtime while being PHP 5-compatible, it is not considered good practice anymore, as we can now rely on the PHP 7 features and use all of its advantages.</p>
<p>One of the major points PHP 7 supports is proper type hinting and return types (apart from PhpDocs), which makes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://m3lkior.github.io/tools/phan.html">static analysis</a> much easier and can improve the overall code quality significantly.</p>
