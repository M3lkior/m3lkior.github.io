<p>A developer can choose from different modules to include necessary functionality such s accessing http resources, databases, and so on. As a consequence, the developer can choose, and is not distracted by or clobbered with irrelevant things. This approach is considered as minimalistic, but it is easy to include necessary functionality.</p>
<p>Regarding the architecture, Play is stateless and built on Akka. As a consequence, Play applications have much lower resource consumption regarding CPU und memory and can scale easily. Play manages concurrency without binding a request to a thread until the response is ready.</p>
<p>With the use of "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html">Futures</a>" in your code you can turn synchronous tasks (such as IO or API call to another service) into asynchronous and you can build non-blocking applications. It is recommended to understand the principles Play uses to achieve performance and scalability.</p>
<p>Play can act as backend service delivering JSON, for example. For building web applications. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaTemplates">Twirl</a> template engine enables server-side rendering of HTML pages. These HTML pages can include CSS and JavaScript parts of your own choice.</p>
