<p>JSON and XML are two well-known formats for serialization of data; however, they come with a few drawbacks. JSON is completely dynamic without any validation (though there is json-schema) and XML uses an extremely heavyweight syntax, which carries a huge overhead, so parsing and transport becomes quite slow.</p>
<p>Protobuf, amongst others, is an approach to solving this problem by using well-defined schemas to create language-specific code, which serializes/marshals and deserializes/unmarshals data. One of the key features is the built-in support for evolving schemas; it is easily possible to incrementally extend the definition while staying backwards-compatible and compose messages consisting of several sub-messages.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a way to have different systems agree on a common protocol on top of a transport layer (such as AMQP or HTTP), Protobuf is definitely worth examining more closely and should be assessed.</p>
