One noteworthy facet of this evolution is Assisted AIâ€”a paradigm that holds great promise for software development companies.</p>
<p>Assisted AI combines human and machine intelligence to enhance productivity. It leverages AI's computational capabilities while preserving human critical thinking.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-and-opportunities">Advantages and Opportunities</h3>
<p>Developers should consider using generative artificial intelligence (AI) for a multitude of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Enhancement</strong>: Assisted AI offers intelligent code suggestions, optimizing and refactoring. It helps save time and boost quality and developer satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Testing</strong>: It accelerates testing, identifies bugs, and generates test cases for more robust, reliable software.</li>
<li><strong>NLP-powered Documentation</strong>: Assisted AI assists in writing precise, comprehensive documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Assisted AI can help identify vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
