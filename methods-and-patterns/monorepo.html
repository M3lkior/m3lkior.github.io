the best fit for every project.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>More efficient code sharing and reusability.</li>
<li>Consistent development environment.</li>
<li>Easier cross-project refactoring.</li>
<li>Improved collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Dependency Management</strong>: In our monorepo, we can manage dependencies at the repository level, simplifying
the process of keeping everything up to date and avoiding version conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined CI/CD Pipeline</strong>: A single CI/CD pipeline that can build and test all our projects simultaneously.
This, of course, comes with the drawback of a more complicated CI/CD setup and potentially longer running pipelines.</li>
<li><strong>Better Code Ownership</strong>: It's easier to determine who is responsible for each part of the codebase, which can
improve code ownership and accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Testing</strong>: We can set up end-to-end tests and integration tests that cover the entire application more
easily in a monorepo, ensuring that changes in one part of the codebase don't break other parts.</li>
<li><strong>Codebase Navigation</strong>: Developers can easily navigate through different parts of the codebase without having to
switch between multiple repositories or projects.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>However, it is important to note that monorepos are not a one-size-fits-all solution.</strong> They can introduce complexity,
especially in very large projects, and may not be suitable for all team sizes or development workflows. The decision to
adopt a monorepo should be based on a careful consideration of your project's specific requirements, team size, and
development practices.</p>
