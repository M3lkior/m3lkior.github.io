configuration - instead of (classic) text-based programming.
Low-code platforms additionally supports certain scripting possibilities.</p>
<p>No-code and low-code platforms have raised a lot of funding and the ecosystem is growing fast. There are more than 400
platforms listed on software selection websites like g2.
The promise of this ecosystem sounds logical: there is a growing demand for digital products and solutions in all
sectors - and skilled teams of developers are scarce.
That's why platforms
like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bubble.io/">bubble.io</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.airtable.com/">airtable</a>,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://about.appsheet.com/home/">appsheet</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bryter.com/">bryter</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ninox.com/de">ninox</a>
and co promise to build digital products faster and better.</p>
<p>And the platforms have developed and the ecosystem is emerging. AI technics are being used to improve the creation
process and modern low-code platforms also come with built-in release and operations support. We have used some low-code
platforms for internal tools, for example to help organise events or onboarding activities.</p>
<p>Here are our thoughts on this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We see opportunities to improve communication and collaboration between developers on such platforms and non-technical
professionals (domain experts), as they can collaborate on the platform directly during the process of creating the
digital product.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the use case fits into the sweet spot of the platform, the results are very fast and surprising.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is a logical trade-off between simplicity and flexibility: platforms with a high level of abstraction and a low
learning curve can deliver good results very quickly. However, if you have requirements that do not fit into the
"standard" of the platform, it becomes difficult to customise. On the other hand, platforms that allow a lot of
configuration and scripting come with a higher learning curve. And in some respects it may end being similar to using
a programming framework.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Operating costs can become a relevant factor - especially if you pay for high performance and higher utilisation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have to realise that with complex applications there is much more to do than "just" writing code. Test
architecture, api design, integrations, careful design of the solution, proper testing, CI/CD strategy etc. So
there is still a need for skilled (development) teams to do this work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about the different aspects, we will not consider low-code platforms as the core technology in complex software
development projects - but we think that even in larger IT projects or organisations there are valid use cases or
certain "bounded contexts" where using a low-code platform is a proper choice and helps to deliver results faster.</p>
