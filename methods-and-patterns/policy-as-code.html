reviews and audits are no longer sufficient. By using code to express policies for the entire infrastructure and
application stack, automated compliance checks become a natural part of the software development lifecycle,
e.g. via integration into a projects' CI/CD pipeline and could even prevent a configuration change or deployment
if a critical issue was found.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of Policy as Code is the ability to catch potential issues before they become risks. For
example, a policy could be defined to ensure that all S3 buckets are encrypted, or that all EC2 instances have a
specific set of tags.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools and frameworks available for implementing Policy as Code. At AOE, we are mainly relying on
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.checkov.io/">Checkov</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kyverno.io/">Kyverno</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/">AWS Config</a>
at the time of writing. Each tool provides a way to define policies in code and then automate policy enforcement.
They also provide visibility into the compliance status of infrastructure and application configurations.</p>
<p>By defining policies as code, development teams can ensure that policies are version-controlled, easily auditable,
and consistent across all environments.</p>
