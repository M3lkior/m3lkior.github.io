Especially for
distributed systems - where a lot of communication between different services happen - it's very important to explicitly
think of implementing resilience.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different resilience patterns, and it is also a matter of the overall software design. Typical
patterns and methods used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not hide API calls or any other external communication in your application (for example with unnecessary
abstraction) - instead make it explicit that an external communication happens - e.g. by using the Facade Pattern. On
the one hand, this makes it obvious that a potential slow and error-prone communication is going to happen, and it
makes it easier to implement error handling.</li>
<li>Detect errors explicitly: Check the response message format and configure proper timeouts for external communication</li>
<li>Handle errors in a smart way: Show a nice error message to your customer or, even better, graceful degrade features -
e.g. by showing some fallback text</li>
<li>Use message-based communication where useful (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://m3lkior.github.io/methods-and-patterns/decoupling-infrastructure-via-messaging.html">Decoupling Infrastructure via Messaging</a>)</li>
<li>Use circuit breakers to isolate errors and allow systems to recover</li>
<li>Use short activation paths in your strategic architecture - so that there is only a minimal set of communications
between your services required for certain features or business requests</li>
</ul>
<p>"Embrace Errors" should be the mindset - because it is not a question if errors appear - it's just a question of when.</p>
