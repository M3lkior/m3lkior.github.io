It enables developers to focus solely on writing code, which is executed in response to events without having to manage the underlying servers or infrastructure. Serverless applications are composed of multiple individual functions or microservices that automatically scale in response to demand.</p>
<p>At AOE, we encourage our development teams to adopt the serverless pattern for its increased scalability, reduced operational overhead, and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-apply-the-serverless-pattern">When to Apply the Serverless Pattern</h3>
<p>Embracing the Serverless pattern can significantly enhance development speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in modern software architectures. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Workloads:</strong> Serverless is ideal for applications with sporadic or unpredictable workloads driven by events like user actions, sensor data, or file uploads.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling Microservices:</strong> Adopt serverless for specific microservices within a larger architecture to simplify deployment and scale.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Use serverless to optimize costs by paying only for the resources consumed during execution.</li>
<li><strong>Prototyping and MVPs:</strong> Quickly build and test minimum viable products (MVPs) and prototypes without extensive infrastructure setup.</li>
<li><strong>Short-Lived Compute:</strong> For tasks that require short bursts of compute power, such as data processing or image resizing.</li>
</ul>
