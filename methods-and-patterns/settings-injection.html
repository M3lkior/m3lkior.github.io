Typical settings include domain names, database credentials and the location of other dependent services such as cache backends, queues or session storages.</p>
<p>These settings should not be shipped with the build package. Instead, it's the environment - this build is being deployed to - that should expose these values to application. A common way to "inject" these values is by making them available as environment variables or dynamically creating configuration files for the application. You can achieve this pattern without special tools - but this concept of settings injection also works with tools such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://m3lkior.github.io/tools/consul.html">Consul</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://m3lkior.github.io/platforms-and-aoe-services/kubernetes.html">kubernetes</a> (with configMaps and secrets) or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/AOEpeople/YAD">YAD</a>.</p>
<p>In this manner, the build package can be independent of the environment it's being deployed to - making it easier to follow the "Build once, deploy often" CI/CD principle.</p>
