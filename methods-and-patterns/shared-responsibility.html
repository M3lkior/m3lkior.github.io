We're not proposing a solution on how to split responsibilities here, but we want to raise awareness for bringing everybody together and formally discuss all responsibilities and write them down similar to (and possibly extending) AWS's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/">shared responsibility model</a>.
Some topics are 24/7 on-call support, broken deployment pipelines, and vulnerability scans.</p>
