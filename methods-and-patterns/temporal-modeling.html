<p>The usual way of modeling software is to find structures, things and relations.
We try to find the relevant aspects of a domain and put all properties into an object-oriented model.
Trying to create a second model for a related business process, having the structural model already in place, might result in a process representation that is tightly coupled with the assumptions built up from the structural model and too far away from reality.</p>
<p>By focusing on the domain processes first, one can visualize all aspects of a process over time.
Having the process visualized, allows to see potential pitfalls or forgotten aspects.
With a temporal model at hand, it is easy to create an object-oriented or structural model that perfectly represents all required information.</p>
<p>We tried this method when tackling big or complex domains.</p>
