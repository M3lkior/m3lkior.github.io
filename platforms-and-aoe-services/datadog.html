Datadog is very simple to set up and retrieves metrics from the AWS API (and many other integrations) and from an agent running on the EC2 instances.
On top of that, it comes with many plugins for services such as Apache, NGINX and ElasticSearch, allowing us to track all important metrics without much effort.
Creating dashboards, setting up alarms and integrating into other applications (such as ticket systems) is easy to do and works fine.</p>
