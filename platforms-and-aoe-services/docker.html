This is how we have used the term "Docker" in the Tech Radar recently.
But Docker is also a complete production platform, where the capability to build and run Containers is only a small fraction of its capabilities.
At the same time numerous alternate runtimes for containers – like containerd and podman – as well as image builders – like Kaniko and Buildah – have evolved during the last years.
Thanks to the standards established by the Open Container Initiative these tools are mostly interchangeable for the purposes of building and running containers.</p>
<p>To be more distinct, we now recommend using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://m3lkior.github.io/platforms-and-aoe-services/oci-container.html">Containers and Runtimes as specified by the Open Container Initiative</a>. 
Docker is one of many tools to achieve that.</p>
