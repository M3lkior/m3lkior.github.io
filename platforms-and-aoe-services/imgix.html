When developing responsive websites, you will quickly reach the point where you need various versions of your images to achieve a good responsive user interface. You want high quality versions for retina displays but small versions for mobile devices with a slow Internet connection.</p>
<p>Especially when dealing with user-generated uploads, it is getting hard to create different versions for any supported device and breakpoint of your web page. Doing this manually is hardly an option.</p>
<p>At AOE, we decided to use imgix as an image processing service for some projects to solve this problem. The benefits of imgix are the simple API to create responsive images in real-time as well as the fast delivery over their CDN.</p>
