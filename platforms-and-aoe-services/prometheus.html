It was the second project within the CNCF which reached the "graduated" status and has since seen a large rate of adoption across many CNCF projects.
It primarily utilizes a pull-based metrics flow through HTTP which allows the easy integration of a variety of application-specific metrics sources.
Compared to other monitoring systems it stands out in its simple, still powerful and fully code-based configuration and the equally powerful service discovery mechanism.</p>
<p>Prometheus integrates very well with Grafana which is our tool of choice for dashboard visualization.
Through the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a> project, the monitoring system can be configured through Kubernetes custom resource definitions.
These can be shipped by development teams alongside with their application deployments and allow <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aoe.com/techradar/methods-and-patterns/shared-responsibility.html">sharing responsibility</a> for monitoring tasks between operations and engineering teams with a clear interface.</p>
<p>With <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a> the Prometheus-ecosystem knows two well-settled solutions for high-availability of the underlying time series database and with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/en/prometheus/">Amazon Managed Services for Prometheus</a> there's also a SaaS-Solution available.</p>
<p>We use Prometheus in nearly every project, it's an essential part of our underlying operations and also well understood by many development teams.</p>
