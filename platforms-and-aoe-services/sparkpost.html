<p>In a lot of projects, it is a typical requirement that different E-Mails need to be sent and that the project stakeholders want to adjust E-Mail templates and content on a relatively regular basis.</p>
<p>Also, (mass) sending E-Mails and avoiding that they are classified as Spam is not an easy topic. That's why we decided to use E-Mail delivery services in our projects and evaluated different providers.</p>
<p>We decided to start using SparkPost because of pricing, feature set and the available reviews on the Internet. However, there are other possible solutions such as SendGrid or Postmark.</p>
