API-First Design Approach puts the API design at the beginning of the implementation without any constraints, for example, from the current IT infrastructure or the implementation itself.\nThe idea is to design the API in a way that it serves its purpose best and the consumers are enabled to work efficiently.</p>\n<p>There are several advantages to this approach. For example, it can help to avoid reflecting the internal structure of the application or any internal constraints.\nFurthermore, as one of the most important design aspects is consistency, one can define features such as the behavior of security, URL schemes, and API keys upfront.\nIt also helps speed up parallel implementation.\nA team that consumes the API can start working directly after the API design because it can easily be mocked.</p>\n<p>There are several tools for modelling an API, but here at AOE we mainly use <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://m3lkior.github.io/tools/raml.html\">RAML</a> as it provides a rich set of tools for generating documentation, mocking and more.\nFor mocking we use <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://m3lkior.github.io/tools/wiremock.html\">WireMock</a>, for example.</p>\n<p>Related to the &quot;API-First&quot; approach is the &quot;Headless&quot; approach where an existing application (with or without existing API) is used as a backend for a separate frontend.\nWe used this with sucess for Magento-based E-Commerce platforms.\nThis allows encapsulating the core features of that application, while integrating it into a larger landscape of components using its API as a unified way to interact between components.\nDecoupling the core logic from its presentation layer allows picking the best technology stack for the various parts independently.</p>\n<p>For further reading see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.programmableweb.com/api-university/understanding-api-first-design\">Understanding API First Design</a></li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/when-crafting-your-api-strategy-put-design-first-1262043?src=rss&attr=all\">When crafting your API strategy, put design first</a></li>\n</ul>\n"}],"name":"api-first-design-approach","title":"API-First Design Approach","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","body":"<p>The API of any software we develop shapes in which way developers, teams, customers and users interact with our\nsoftware.</p>\n<p>No matter if a Frontend-API like GraphQL, a rpc-API like gRPC or an internal API published by a module in a larger\nproject or shared library, messing the API up always creates headaches and is hard to correct.\nIf we stick to semantic versioning, it&#39;s actually pretty impossible to change a once-published API without breaking\nconsumers.</p>\n<p>By today&#39;s standards we prioritize API design before actual development, to be clear on how our software interacts, and\nthus move this pattern to &quot;adopt&quot;.</p>\n","info":"","angleFraction":0.11726251370022989,"radiusFraction":0.22841216817780197,"release":"2022-03-28","fileName":"/Users/ludovicdussart/Documents/Workplace/Zatsit/techradar/radar/2022-03-28/api-first-design-approach.md","tags":["architecture"]},{"flag":"default","featured":true,"revisions":[{"name":"apicurio","release":"2021-07-01","title":"Apicurio Studio","ring":"trial","quadrant":"tools","tags":["architecture"],"fileName":"/Users/ludovicdussart/Documents/Workplace/Zatsit/techradar/radar/2021-07-01/apicurio.md","body":"<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.apicur.io/studio/\">Apicurio Studio</a> is a browser-based, open-source API design studio.

The many additional abstraction layers can result in decreased performance.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, OroPlatform gives you a good head start for prototyping and frees you from rebuilding common requirements - which makes it a relevant choice for business applications with the need to manage several entities in a backend. Also, projects such <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://m3lkior.github.io/tools/akeneo.html\">Akeneo</a> or OroCRM use OroPlatform with success.</p>\n<p>Since the project is still young, the future development and improvements need to be watched.

It provides a reliable and scalable way to transport data between loosely coupled applications, using different EAI patterns such as the Publish &amp; Subscriber pattern. AMQP supports direct and fan-out exchanges (broadcasts) as well as topics. Queuing mechanisms allow for robust architectures, mitigating the risks of application downtimes. Typically, a RabbitMQ server can easily buffer millions of messages. RabbitMQ supports JMS in addition to AMQP. It is not intended to use JMS for new systems, but it makes RabbitMQ useful for integrating legacy systems.</p>\n<p>There are several alternative solutions to RabbitMQ, e. g. the free Apache ActiveMQ, which is integrated in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://m3lkior.github.io/tools/anypoint-platform.html\">Anypoint platform</a>.

RSCs represent a new application architecture paradigm within React designed to reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. The ultimate goal is to enhance performance, user experience, and maintainability.</p>\n<p>This new feature enables the creation of components that exclusively run on the server. As a result, there is no impact on the bundle size downloaded by the client. For instance, libraries used in server components are not shipped to the client. RSCs also have the capability to access server-side resources, such as databases and the file system, directly.</p>\n<p>In addition to server components, there are client components, which are essentially the classic components everyone is familiar with. The only distinction is that client components need to be explicitly declared using a directive. Determining which components should be client or server can be one of the more challenging aspects, especially when the goal is to migrate existing applications.</p>\n<p>RSCs appear to be most effective when used with Server Side Rendering, although it is possible to use them without it. RSCs and Server Side Rendering complement each other well, as server components are only rendered once on the server and do not need to be sent to the client. Client components are still rendered on the server and then hydrated on the client side. However, with a well-structured application that minimizes client-side code and in combination with React 18&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37\">Suspense and Selective Hydration</a> features, a performance boost is expected.

RSCs represent a new application architecture paradigm within React designed to reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. The ultimate goal is to enhance performance, user experience, and maintainability.</p>\n<p>This new feature enables the creation of components that exclusively run on the server. As a result, there is no impact on the bundle size downloaded by the client. For instance, libraries used in server components are not shipped to the client. RSCs also have the capability to access server-side resources, such as databases and the file system, directly.</p>\n<p>In addition to server components, there are client components, which are essentially the classic components everyone is familiar with. The only distinction is that client components need to be explicitly declared using a directive. Determining which components should be client or server can be one of the more challenging aspects, especially when the goal is to migrate existing applications.</p>\n<p>RSCs appear to be most effective when used with Server Side Rendering, although it is possible to use them without it. RSCs and Server Side Rendering complement each other well, as server components are only rendered once on the server and do not need to be sent to the client. Client components are still rendered on the server and then hydrated on the client side. However, with a well-structured application that minimizes client-side code and in combination with React 18&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37\">Suspense and Selective Hydration</a> features, a performance boost is expected.

It can be used for scripting, scraping and general automation or as a functional/web/acceptance testing solution via integration with testing frameworks such as Spock, JUnit &amp; TestNG.</p>\n<p>At AOE, we use Spock in combination with Geb in various projects for black-box testing. Mainly, we implement our functional integration and acceptance testing automation with these frameworks, which work together seamlessly. And, we also like the convenience of extending the tests with Groovy built-ins or custom extensions.</p>\n<p>Because of the successful use in two of our large projects and the wide range of opportunities within the testing domain with Spock and Geb, we classify this combo with adopt.</p>\n<!--except-->\n"}],"name":"spock_geb","title":"Spock + Geb","ring":"hold","quadrant":"languages-and-frameworks","body":"<p>Most projects at AOE have transitioned away from Groovy, and other testing frameworks for JVM languages are more advanced and user-friendly.

Especially with the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://m3lkior.github.io/methods-and-patterns/microservices.html\">Microservice</a> approach, it is important to define and connect services following the low coupling - high cohesion principles by idendifying fitting bounded contexts.</p>\n<p>The following chart gives an overview of possible relationships between bounded contexts:\n<img src=\"https://m3lkior.github.io/images/strategic-domain-driven-design-relationships.png\" alt=\"strategic-domain-driven-design-relationships\"></p>\n<p>While we have found that this approach is especially useful in designing distributed systems and applications with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://m3lkior.github.io/methods-and-patterns/microservices.html\">microservices</a>, we have also extended this approach to provide guidelines for general enterprise architectures.</p>\n","info":"","angleFraction":0.7672794818785058,"radiusFraction":0.7576256746872887,"release":"2017-03-01","tags":["architecture"],"fileName":"/Users/ludovicdussart/Documents/Workplace/Zatsit/techradar/radar/2017-03-01/strategic-domain-driven-design.md"},{"flag":"default","featured":true,"revisions":[{"name":"stride-threat-modeling","release":"2019-11-01","title":"STRIDE Threat Modeling","ring":"trial","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","tags":["security"],"fileName":"/Users/ludovicdussart/Documents/Workplace/Zatsit/techradar/radar/2019-11-01/stride-threat-modeling.md","body":"<p>STRIDE is a model of threat groups that helps to identify security threats to any application, component or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The acronym stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spoofing</li>\n<li>Tampering</li>\n<li>Repudiation</li>\n<li>Information disclosure</li>\n<li>Denial of service</li>\n<li>Elevation of privilege</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AOE is applying the threat model in collaborative sessions using the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/285.elevation-of-privilege-the-game.aspx\">Elevation of Privilege Card Game</a> which helps to spark imagination and makes threats more tangible. </p>\n"}],"name":"stride-threat-modeling","title":"STRIDE Threat Modeling","ring":"trial","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","body":"<p>STRIDE is a model of threat groups that helps to identify security threats to any application, component or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The acronym stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spoofing</li>\n<li>Tampering</li>\n<li>Repudiation</li>\n<li>Information disclosure</li>\n<li>Denial of service</li>\n<li>Elevation of privilege</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AOE is applying the threat model in collaborative sessions using the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/285.elevation-of-privilege-the-game.aspx\">Elevation of Privilege Card Game</a> which helps to spark imagination and makes threats more tangible. </p>\n","info":"","angleFraction":0.8790242660293255,"radiusFraction":0.764245890887935,"release":"2019-11-01","tags":["security"],"fileName":"/Users/ludovicdussart/Documents/Workplace/Zatsit/techradar/radar/2019-11-01/stride-threat-modeling.md"},{"flag":"default","featured":false,"revisions":[{"name":"styleguide-driven-development","release":"2018-03-01","title":"Styleguide Driven Development","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","fileName":"/Users/ludovicdussart/Documents/Workplace/Zatsit/techradar/radar/2018-03-01/styleguide-driven-development.md","body":"<p>Updated to &quot;adopt&quot;.</p>\n"},{"name":"styleguide-driven-development","release":"2017-03-01","title":"Styleguide Driven Development","ring":"trial","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","fileName":"/Users/ludovicdussart/Documents/Workplace/Zatsit/techradar/radar/2017-03-01/styleguide-driven-development.md","body":"<p>The goal of Styleguide Driven Development is to develop your application user Interface independently and reusable in a Pattern Library.<br>In the old days, the frontend was developed based on page-centric Photoshop files which made it hard to change things afterwards.
