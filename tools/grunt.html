While Grunt served us well for a good amount of projects,
other alternatives such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> emerged in the meantime and proved to be a better pick for the
majority of our teams.</p>
<p>We have two main reasons for discarding Grunt in favor of other tools:</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>If a decent amount of tasks is reached, Grunt is known to run slower than other tools, because it heavily relies on I/O operations and
always stores the result of one task as files on the disk.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>On large projects where a lot of automation is required, it can get very tedious to maintain complex and parallel running tasks.
The grunt configuration files sometimes simply donÂ´t gave us the flexibility that we needed.</p>
<p>Currently, our preferred way to go is either simply use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">npm scripts</a> or rely on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/">Webpack loaders</a> for file preprocessing. For non-webpack projects we also utilize Gulp.</p>
