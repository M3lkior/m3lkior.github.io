It's easy to get started with and comes with a wide range of built-in features. Playwright works on Windows, macOS, and Linux and seamlessly integrates with popular testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine.</p>
<p>Playwright's configuration offers valuable options, including native mobile emulation for Chrome on Android and Safari on iOS. It can also be extended using BDD tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow, allowing non-technical contributors to collaborate.</p>
<p>Playwright tests are robust, as they wait for elements before taking actions to eliminate timeouts, a common cause of unreliable tests.</p>
<p>In contrast to Cypress, Playwright excels at interacting with different origins and multiple tabs in tests. You can create scenarios with distinct contexts to handle various users within a test, saving authentication states for reuse in other tests, thus eliminating repetitive log-in operations.</p>
<p>Developed and maintained by Microsoft, Playwright benefits from extensions for Visual Studio Code, streamlining test development, execution, and debugging.</p>
<p>In summary, Playwright is a versatile testing tool offering compatibility, integration with testing frameworks, and advanced features like multi-origin interactions. Its robustness, ability to handle diverse scenarios, and close ties with Visual Studio Code make it an exceptional choice for end-to-end testing.</p>
