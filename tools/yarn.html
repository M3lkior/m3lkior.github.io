<p>Yarn consistently offers better performance than npm and, in addition, provides both offline installation and the Plug'n'Play approach. With Plug'n'Play mode, Yarn replaces the node_modules directory with a virtual file system to enhance performance and save disk space.</p>
<p>Yarn is an excellent choice for monorepos, thanks to its support for workspaces, and is highly recommended as a package manager.</p>
